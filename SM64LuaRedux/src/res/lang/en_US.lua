This page lets you play back a sequence of TAS inputs starting from a specific state with immediate effect.

The purpose of this is to quickly iterate over the effects of small changes "in the past" in order to more efficiently iterate over different implementations of the same strategy.

By managing so-called "Semantic Workflow Projects", it is possible to author entire runs in terms of semantics consisting of just a few sections.

This tool is separated into several tab pages that you can select at the top. Once you have started work on a Semantic Workflow Project, a dedicated help page will be available for each tab just like for this one.

Click the "next" arrow at the top to learn more about how to get started.

The main entity you will be working with is the "Sheet".
A Sheet describes a sequence of inputs, that, starting from a specific point, will (attempt to) perform a certain sequence of actions that make up a segment of a complete run.
Sheets are divided further into sections, with each section ending when either a certain number of frames has passed, or a certain other condition is met.

This page allows you to manage several related Sheets in a so called "Semantic Workflow Project".
Semantic Workflow Projects are really just a collection of Sheets that are saved in a directory next to the semantic workflow project file (*.swp).
You can create, save and load projects using the respective buttons at the top.

The "New" button will ask for a location for the new project. It is recommended that you create a new empty directory for the new project, as having multiple projects in the same directory could have them unintendedly interfere with each other.
The "Save" button will always save over the currently loaded project file without confirmation, unless you haven't opened or created any project yet.

Once you are satisfied with your work, you will probably want to record it into a .m64 file.
To do this, open a .m64 file in mupen as normal and let it play until a state that matches the savestate of the first sheet you want to play back semantically.
Then enter read/write mode so that frames can be recorded.
You may also achieve this by simply starting a new recording from the savestate of the first sheet.

Then, hit the right pointing arrows ("Play without loading .st") for each sheet in order. (Make sure to let them play to the end before hitting the next one)
This, of course, assumes that the Sheets are "stitched together" correctly, i.e. that each Sheet you click starts where the previous Sheet ends (i.e. where its preview frame ends up being).

Do not play back .m64 movies while authoring Sheets, as this will produce unpredictable inputs.
When playing back a .m64 file, make sure that no sheet is selected in the Project's Sheet list.

The Semantic Workflow Project file and its associated Sheet files follow a human readable file format.
In order to keep track of the work done on a TAS, I recommend initializing a local git repository in the the directory where the .swp file is located.
This way, you can save your project and make a commit whenever you have made significant progress, and manage different branches to compare strategies.
This helps with keeping track of progress, preventing loss of work, and keeping things organized.

To make a commit, simply hit "Save" and commit all changes.
After checking out a commit or branch, you will need to "Open" the .swp file again to load everything from your drive into memory.

You may even find it beneficial to manage other files with git, too, such as ghosts, recorded .m64 files, STROOP tracker configurations or Strat write-ups!

The .sws and .swp files follow semantic versioning; that is, a <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH> format.
Compare the running script version (top right next to the help button) with the file version as seen in the Project tab to understand what's happening:

MAJOR versions may be both upwards and downwards incompatible with each other.
Upgrade or downgrade the script accordingly.

MINOR versions may be upwards incompatible,
for example when the higher MINOR file version introduces a new feature not yet supported by the lower script version.

PATCH versions should be both upwards and downwards compatible within the same MINOR version, as they are meant for bugfixes only.
However, as is the nature of bugs, this may sometimes not be done quite right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Click the "#Section" column in the Section List to select the "preview frame" (highlighted in red).
You can expand and collapse sections that have more than one initial input frame.
Click the middle column in the Section List to select the "active frame" (highlighted in green), which is used for editing (more on that on the next help page).

Whenever you make changes to any inputs (e.g. change any button inputs), the game is going to be replayed to the preview frame from the start of the Sheet with the new inputs.

The "+Section" and "-Section" buttons add and remove a section at the currently selected section respectively.
A sheet must always have at least one section.

The "+Input" and "-Input" buttons add and remove a frame at the selected frame in the selected section respectively.
This is useful to initiate a new action such as a long jump, for example after landing from a previous rollout.

The controls at the bottom behave similarly to the standard "TAS" view you may be familiar with, just in a more condensed layout.

You can select a range of joystick inputs to edit by left clicking and dragging over the mini-joysticks in the desired range. Hold the CTRL key to not reset the selection when left clicking.
The selected range will follow the active frame highlighted by a green border.
Its values will be displayed in the joystick controls at the bottom, and when you make any changes, those values will copied to the selected range.

If the 'Edit entire state' toggle in the preferences page is off, only the changes made to the active frame (rather than all its values) will be copied to the selected range.

When the active frame and the preview frame are the same, the highlight will become a yellow-ish green.

To edit button inputs, simply click and drag over the small circles on the right.

This page displays and edits settings that are not stored in a Semantic Workflow Project, and instead persist in your local settings instead.
Each setting may get an individual help page here in the future. For now, here is a brief list of what each setting does:

- Edit entire state: Copy the entire joystick state of the active frame to the selected range in the "Inputs" page. When turned off, only the changed values will be copied to the selected range.

- Fast Forward: Play the game back at maximum speed when re-running a sheet (e.g. when making changes). When turned off, the game will play back in real time instead.

- Default section timeout: The number of frames after which a newly created section will time out by default.
