# Dumping

# Ghost

To play back a ghost file, use [Frame's STROOP](https://github.com/chaosBrick/STROOP/releases) and press "Enable Ghost Hack" after having recorded a ghost using SM64 Lua Redux, then save and load a savestate. The resulting emulator state and savestate should contain the ghost hack.
