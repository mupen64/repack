# repack

The official TAS-ready bundle containing Mupen64 and plugins.

Repack by Skazzy3 | Last update: 2025-05-14

REMEMBER TO DISABLE FRAME BUFFER IN "GLideN64 4.0" TO AVOID CRASHES AND INPUT LAG
DISABLE ANY TEXTURE ENHANCEMENTS IN "Glide64 Final" TO AVOID CRASHES

(GLideN64 and Glide64 are two different plugins)

Changes:

- Includes version 1.2.0 of Mupen64-RR LUA (Check for updates here: https://github.com/mkdasher/mupen64-rr-lua-/releases)
- Updated PJ64 1.6 plugins to PJ64 1.6.1 variants (except Jabo's DirectSound as Fast Forward won't work.)
- Replaced outdated plugins with newer variants
- The filename for a ROM is now displayed by default (to avoid confusing names of ROM hacks)
- Added x264vfw for encoding


New plugins added:
Video: Direct64 0.5.03.25, better gln 1.3, GlideN64 4.0, Glide64 Final, 
Audio: Shunyuans HLE audio plugin v1.8.2
Input: NRage Input V2.3d, TAS Input 1.2.0
RSP: hacktarux-azimer-rsp-hle 0.3.0, mupen64plus-rsp-hle 1.0.0


Notes: 
- Certain SM64 ROM hacks will show black textures when using GLideN64, use Glide64 Final, glN64, or Direct64 instead.
- Default video plugin is set to Jabo's Direct3D. If your computer has a relatively recent video card then 
switch to GLideN64 for better results.
- Default audio plugin is set to Jabo's DirectSound. Use Shunyuans audio for better quality in YouTube videos/AVI Capture.
(Fast forwarding does not work without Jabo's DirectSound
- N-Rages Input plugin shows up as 2.3c in the plugin settings. Actual version included is 2.3d
